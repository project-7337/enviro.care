# RASOI
Connecting people to their homes, through food made with love.

## Inspiration
Looking at the impact of this pandemic many people have lost their livelihood and are doing whatever they can to survive. While many developed a passion to cook and became so good at it, that they have been selling the food from their own RASOI (kitchen) with the help of social media. We intend to build a platform where anyone can prepare their menu and list it on our platform.

## What it does
We have built a platform where any RASOI owner can register with us post the verification checks and start selling from their own RASOI(kitchen). The menu can be changed every day according to the RASOI owner. The RASOI owner has the flexibility to create it's own menu and the time till it's available to serve. From there, our delivery partners will help us in delivering the food like any other food delivery service available.

**How we are different?**
1. There is a flexible menu created by each RASOI owner every day.
2. The RASOI owners can specify the quantity in which they have prepared the food and our platform makes sure to display the dynamic quantity as per the order.
2. This helps our customers get fresh homemade meals every day.
3. The RASOI owner need not worry about the delivery of the food, just package the food and it will be collected by one of our delivery partners.
4. This creates an ecosystem where each RASOI owner can reach a big and wider audience.

## What's next for rasoi
1. We intend to continue to build our platform to a viable product for the market.
2. We will be adding a strict verification process for the RASOI owners and providing them with all the resources to start.
3. Every day the RASOI owners will be required to add proof of hygiene in the form of a video or image that will be monitored by our AI.
4. We will help the RASOI owners to expand their business and income, by providing them with the required resources.
